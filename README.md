Match AI is an intelligent matching system that uses data-driven logic and machine learning concepts to connect users based on compatibility. 
The project explores how algorithms, scoring systems, and AI-based decision-making can be applied to real-world matching problems such as friendships, teams, or interest-based connections.
This project was built to demonstrate skills in computer science, data analysis, and algorithmic thinking, with an emphasis on practical AI applications.
